My name is Brian Bauska. I am a data wrangler by profession.  I have the following qualities:

- I rock a baseball cap
- I drive a ford and bmw
- I write websites.  188 and counting as of today 8/6/2023
- I'm extremely loyal to my family, particularly my grandbabies

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
